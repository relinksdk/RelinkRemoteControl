We decided to use what is know by everybody already, Intent. Replace Intent by RemoteIntent, add the receiver ID and that's it :)\r\n\r\n`Intent intent = RemoteIntent(<remote_id>, \"SET_SOUND\");`\r\n`intent.putExtra(\"level\", 80);`\r\n`startActivity(intent);`\r\n\r\nThat's it.\r\nOn the remote device, just catch the intent and do what you want with.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
